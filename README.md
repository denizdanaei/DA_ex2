# DA-ex2

Implement Suzuki’s and Kasami’s algorithm for mutual exclusion in a distributed system with Java/RMI.

Run with `./run` and cleanup background processes with `./cleanup`.  This needs execution privileges (`chmod +x <script_name>`).  
Simulation flow can be altered in the Simulator class, `run()` method.  
Critical section delay is modeled with number of request. Make sure that total sum of critical section delays is not
larger than total number of requests.
